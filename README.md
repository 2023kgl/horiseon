# HTML CSS GIT - Refactor Existing Code

## Description

My motivation for this challenge was to be better at working with HTML and CSS.
This challenge helped me understand better how HTML and CSS work alone and together. 
A problem I came across was when I was adding the semantic elements on the HTML. 
I changed the navigation list from div to nav and when I opened it on the webpage, it was showing a bullet list instead of a navigation on the top right of the page.
I then realized I didn't update the style sheet for the navigation and once I did, the webpage looks and functions as it is supposed to.
I learned the importance of organize the HTML and CSS files. I have a way better understanding of how they work.

## Credits

Functioning webpage HTML and CSS were provided by the bootcamp course in the classwork folder.
I used the classwork 01-activities as a recap and guidance.
I used google to help me better understand some of the terms and sybmols used.
